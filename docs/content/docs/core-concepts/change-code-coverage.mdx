# **Changed Code Coverage**

**Changed Code Coverage** allows you to focus on the test coverage of the changed code.

## Dimensions


### **New (File) Line Coverage**

**Calculation Logic:**
1. git diff between two commits => changed files => changed line numbers (may include comments and blank lines)
2. Traverse the changed files' **coverageMap** to check if the locations of **branchMap**, **fnMap**, and **statementMap** include the changed line numbers
3. **Covered** definition: The **branchMap**, **fnMap**, and **statementMap** where the changed line numbers are located are all covered

**Calculation Formula:**


```
New (File) Line Coverage = Covered (File) Lines / Total New (File) Lines
```

### **New Branch Coverage**

**Calculation Logic:**
1. git diff between two commits => changed files => changed line numbers
2. Traverse the changed files' **coverageMap** to check if the locations of **branchMap** include the changed line numbers
3. **Covered** definition: The **branchMap** where the changed line numbers are located is covered

**Calculation Formula:**
```
New Branch Coverage = Covered Branches / Total New Branches
```

### **New Function Coverage**

**Calculation Logic:**
1. git diff between two commits => changed files => changed line numbers
2. Traverse the changed files' **coverageMap** to check if the locations of **fnMap** include the changed line numbers
3. **Covered** definition: The **fnMap** where the changed line numbers are located is covered

**Calculation Formula:**
```
New Function Coverage = Covered Functions / Total New Functions
```

### **New Statement Coverage**
**Calculation Logic:**
1. git diff between two commits => changed files => changed line numbers
2. Traverse the changed files' **coverageMap** to check if the locations of **statementMap** include the changed line numbers
3. **Covered** definition: The **statementMap** where the changed line numbers are located is covered
**Calculation Formula:**
```
New Statement Coverage = Covered Statements / Total New Statements
```
