# First Coverage Data

> [!NOTE]
>
> Canyon provides [installation guides for common frameworks](/docs/installation/getting-started) to help you get started quickly.

Follow these steps to complete your first coverage data report:

## Starting as a New Project

<Steps>
  ### Installation

Babel is essential in frontend engineering and modular development. For Babel projects, you can get started quickly by installing just two Babel plugins.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install babel-plugin-istanbul babel-plugin-canyon -D
```

Add the [`istanbul`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-istanbul) and [`canyon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-canyon) plugins to your [Babel configuration file](https://babeljs.io/docs/config-files#configuration-file-types):

  ```js filename="babel.config.js" {3,4} copy
  module.exports = {
    plugins: [
      'istanbul',
      'canyon'
      // Note the plugin order: canyon plugin should be after istanbul plugin
      ],
  };
  ```

### Verification

After configuration, start your project and print **window.\_\_coverage\_\_** in the console. If the output matches the image below, code instrumentation was successful.

### Configure CI Environment Variables

In CI environments, we need to configure some environment variables to report coverage data.

> [!TIP]
>
> Canyon detects pipeline variables at compile time, and we support multiple [pipeline providers](/docs/reference/provider).<br/>
> Don't see your pipeline provider? Try [explicit configuration](/docs/ecosystem/babel-plugin-canyon#配置).


1. `DSN` and `REPORTER`

- **DSN**: Service address for coverage data reporting, \{\{url\}\}/coverage/client, where \{\{url\}\} is the Canyon service address.
- **REPORTER**: User token, which can be viewed on the Canyon user settings page.

2. Configure CI Platform Variables

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Project ID, branch, and SHA do not need to be manually configured; the Canyon plugin will automatically detect pipeline environment variables.
</Callout>

  ### Update Babel Plugin Activation Conditions

  __In the CI phase, we need to control plugin activation conditions to prevent instrumentation in production branches.__

  ```js {2,3} copy
  module.exports = {
    plugins: (process.env.CI &&
              process.env.CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME !== 'release')
              ? [
                'istanbul',
                'canyon'
              ]:[],
  };
  ```

  ### Report Coverage Data

  Wait for CI to complete, then deploy the page to the test environment.

  At this point, coverage data is stored in the browser. As users interact or UI automation tests execute, window.__coverage___ data will continue to accumulate.

  Reporting this data accurately to the Canyon server enables real-time display of coverage data.


  Here are several ways to report coverage data:
