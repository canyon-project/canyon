# Custom Data Reporting

In some scenarios, especially when APP-embedded H5 pages need to report coverage data, since there is no Canyon Chrome extension similar to PC, custom implementation of coverage data reporting functionality is required.

## Applicable Scenarios

- APP-embedded H5 pages
- Environments where Canyon Chrome extension cannot be used
- Scenarios requiring custom reporting logic
- Mobile web applications

## Implementation Solution

The following is a basic custom reporting implementation solution:

```javascript copy
const coverageFirstValue = Object.values(window.__coverage__||{})[0];
if (coverageFirstValue) {
  fetch(coverageFirstValue.dsn,{
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Content-Type': 'application/json',
      Authorization: `Bearer ${coverageFirstValue.reporter}`
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
      coverage: window.__coverage__,
      ...coverageFirstValue
    })
  })
}
```
