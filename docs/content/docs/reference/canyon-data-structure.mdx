# CanyonJS Data Structure Dictionary

Core field descriptions for coverage query and aggregation, grouped by "Query Dimension / Build Dimension / Report Dimension / Statistics Scope".

## Coverage Query Dimensions

| Field | Meaning | Example/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| provider | Code provider | `gitlab`, `github`, `gitea` |
| repoID | Repository ID | For example `123` or `org/repo` |
| subject | Query subject | `commit` / `pull` / `multiple-commits` |
| subjectID | Subject ID | `commit` → commit SHA; `pull` → pull ID |

## Build Dimensions

| Field | Meaning | Example/Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| buildProvider | Build provider | For example `gitlab runner` |
| buildID | Build ID | For example `123456` |
| buildTarget | Build target | Used for single-repo multi-platform (e.g., `web`/`ios`/`android`); when merging coverage, statistics need to be distinguished by `buildTarget` |

## Report Dimensions

| --- | --- | --- |
| reportProvider | Coverage/test case provider | Such as `playwright`, manual testing |
| reportID | Report/test case ID | Custom identifier for distinguishing different report sources |

## Statistics Scope

Each `buildTarget` is recommended to configure a `scope`, including `includes` and `excludes`, for independent statistics.

```json
[
    {
        "buildTarget": "web",
        "includes": ["src/web/**"],
        "excludes": ["**/*.spec.ts", "**/__tests__/**"]
    },
    {
        "buildTarget": "app",
        "includes": ["src/app/**"],
        "excludes": ["**/*.spec.ts", "**/__tests__/**"]
    }
]
```
