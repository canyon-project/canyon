## Project Structure

Canyon is a JavaScript code coverage collection platform. We address the difficulties developers and QA engineers encounter in collecting test case code coverage during end-to-end testing. It consists of three main parts:

- A Babel plugin responsible for adapting to various CI tools and reading environment variables.

- A backend service responsible for collecting and processing coverage data, and providing coverage reporting interfaces.

- A frontend service responsible for displaying coverage reports.
