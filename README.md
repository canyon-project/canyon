## Features

**Bundling:** Support for various bundling ecosystems.

- `vite` - vite-plugin-istanbul
- `babel` - babel-plugin-istanbul
- `swc` - swc-coverage-instrument

**React Native:** Support for collecting coverage data in React Native.

**File:** Supports multiple file types, such as js, jsx, ts, and tsx.

**Source Traceback:** Enable the sourceMap option to trace back to the original source code coverage information.

**CI:** Provides coverage interfaces for easy integration with CI tools.

**Changed Code:** Configure the baseline commit SHA or branch name you want to compare, filter the coverage of changed files, and calculate the overall coverage of newly added lines.

**Reporting Component:** Build a minimal native JavaScript npm package, providing a modern frontend reporting hydration solution to replace traditional istanbul reports.

**Browser Plugin:** Provide a browser plugin for developers to detect application coverage details in real-time.

Canyon is a JavaScript code coverage collection platform. We address the difficulties developers and QA engineers encounter in collecting test case code coverage during end-to-end testing. It consists of three main parts:

- A Babel plugin responsible for adapting to various CI tools and reading environment variables.

- A backend service responsible for collecting and processing coverage data, and providing coverage reporting interfaces.

- A frontend service responsible for displaying coverage reports.
