# Separating Hit and Map

Collecting initial coverage source files generated during Babel compilation in CI

## Reasons

1. **Collecting Complete Compilation Files**: During the post-compilation process, the `babel-plugin-canyon` plugin analyzes and parses
   the initial coverage files for each compiled file and saves them to the `.canyon_out` folder.

2. **Early Collection, Reduced Load**: When you haven't reported the initial coverage files, these coverage files will be reported during UI automation testing,
   which creates significant transmission load. Early collection can reduce transmission load by over 90%.

> [!TIP]
>
> While this is not mandatory, it is strongly recommended if you need accurate and stable coverage data collection.

## Reporting Initial Coverage Data

The babel-plugin-canyon plugin generates original coverage files for compiled files during compilation and saves them to the .canyon_output folder. We provide the canyon-uploader command-line tool, which you can use to report to the Canyon server in CI.
