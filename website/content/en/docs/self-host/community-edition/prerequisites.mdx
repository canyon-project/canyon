# Prerequisites

Prerequisites for installing Canyon on your own infrastructure.

Canyon is a self-hosted API development platform packaged as a set of Docker containers. You can install and run Canyon on any operating system that can run [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine). You can use Canyon on your local machine or with your chosen cloud provider.

## System Requirements

Canyon is designed to run well in both small and large deployments. The minimum requirements for running Canyon are a Docker-supported operating system and 4 CPU cores + 4GB RAM to generate build images, and at least 1 CPU core + 2GB RAM to host the generated output files.

### Install Node.js, npm, pnpm

#### Node.js + npm

Install [`Node.js`](https://nodejs.org/en) (v18+) and [`npm`](https://www.npmjs.com) (v9+).

### Docker

Install [`Docker`](https://www.docker.com) (v20+).

### Postgres Database

Canyon uses a Postgres database to store basic data (requires 14.x or higher). You can use any Postgres database provider of your choice - hosted locally or with a cloud provider. Ensure you have a valid Postgres database URL in the following format:

```
postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/dbname
```

#### Create Tables

```shell
pnpm run migrate
```

Or you can directly use the table creation [SQL](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon/blob/main/packages/canyon-backend/prisma/create_table.sql).
