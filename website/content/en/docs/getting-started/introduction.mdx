# Introduction

## Overview

Canyon (meaning "canyon", pronounced /ˈkænjən/) is a JavaScript code coverage collection platform. We solve the difficulties that developers and QA engineers encounter when collecting test case code coverage during end-to-end testing. It consists of three main components:

- A series of [plugins](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon/tree/main/plugins) responsible for adapting various CI providers and detecting environment variables.

- A [Node.js service](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon/tree/main/packages/canyon-backend) responsible for collecting and processing coverage data and providing backend APIs.

- A [React frontend application](https://github.com/canyon-project/canyon/tree/main/packages/canyon-platform) responsible for displaying coverage data.

## Why Canyon?

Canyon efficiently handles large amounts of coverage data generated by UI automation testing by separating hit and map data during the compilation phase.

Additionally, Canyon adapts to common CI providers and can insert probe code during the build phase, collecting and reporting coverage data during the UI automation testing phase.

This enables development teams to __accurately__ and __realtime__ understand the coverage situation of __each test case__ in current UI automation testing, thereby better evaluating and improving code quality.

### Key Features

- [Accurate and Efficient](/docs/core-concepts/separate-hit-and-map): Generate initial coverage data at compile time by separating hit and map, accurately and efficiently collect coverage data
- [SourceMap](/docs/core-concepts/restore-source-code-coverage): Accurate source code coverage restoration
- [Build Tools](/docs/installation/getting-started): Provide coverage solutions for common build tools like Next.js, Vite, Webpack
- [Automation Frameworks](/docs/end-to-end-testing/getting-started): Provide integration solutions for common UI automation frameworks
- [CI Providers](/docs/reference/provider): Adapt to common CI providers (Github Actions, GitLab Runner), detect CI environment variables

### Self-Hosting

If you want complete control over your coverage data and test data, you can [self-host](/docs/self-host/community-edition/prerequisites) Canyon on your own infrastructure.

## Architecture

The following diagram shows the architecture of some components of Canyon and its ecosystem:

1. Babel plugin completes code instrumentation in the CI/CD pipeline.
2. The project is deployed to the test environment, where users can choose UI automation or manual testing to trigger the instrumented code probes.
3. Generated coverage data is reported to the Canyon server.
4. The Canyon server consumes the data and generates coverage reports combined with source code information provided by GitLab.
