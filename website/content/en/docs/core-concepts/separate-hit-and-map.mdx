# Separate Hit and Map

Collect initial coverage source files generated by Babel compilation in CI

## Reasons

1. **Collect complete compilation files**: During the compilation process, through the `babel-plugin-canyon` plugin, analyze and parse each compilation file's initial coverage file and save it to the `.canyon_out` folder.

2. **Collect early to reduce pressure**: When you don't report initial coverage files, UI automation tests will report these coverage files, which creates enormous transmission pressure. Early collection can reduce transmission pressure by over 90%.

> [!TIP]
>
> This is not mandatory, but if you need accurate and stable coverage data collection, it's strongly recommended to configure this.

## Report Initial Coverage Data

The babel-plugin-canyon plugin generates initial coverage files for compilation files during compilation and saves them to the .canyon_output folder. We provide the canyon-uploader command-line tool, which you can use to report to the Canyon server in CI.

```yml filename=".github/workflows/report-canyon-output.yml" {19,20} copy
name: Report Canyon Output

jobs:
  report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: "18" # You can modify the Node.js version based on project requirements
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - name: Generate output
        run: npm run build

      # Report .canyon_output file content
      - name: Report output
        run: canyon-uploader map --dsn=https://canyonjs.org
```

## Update Babel Plugin

Configure the keepMap option to false

```js filename="babel.config.js" {7} copy
module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    "istanbul",
    [
      "canyon",
      {
        keepMap: false,
      },
    ],
  ],
};
```

## Ready

Now check the window.coverage object on the page, see the screenshot. The window.coverage no longer contains map data, which can greatly reduce the massive transmission costs during UI automation coverage collection.
