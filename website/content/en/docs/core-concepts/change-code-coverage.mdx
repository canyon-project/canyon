# Change Code Coverage

Change code coverage allows you to focus on the testing situation of the changed code this time.

## Calculation Logic

1. git diff gets `added lines` and `deleted lines` for each file
2. By traversing the coverage data of the changed file, compare whether `added lines` are covered in `all dimensions`
3. Calculate the change code coverage of a single file. Formula: `(added lines - uncovered lines) / added lines`

> [!TIP]
>
> Among them, many `added lines` do not belong to any of `branch`, `function`, or `statement`, but participate in the calculation and are considered `covered` by default.
