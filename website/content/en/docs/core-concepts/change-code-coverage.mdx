# **Changed Code Coverage**

**Changed Code Coverage** allows you to focus on the test coverage of the code changes in this commit.

## Dimensions


### **Added (File) Line Coverage**

**Calculation Logic:**
1. git diff between two commits to get the difference files => difference line numbers (may include comments, blank lines)
2. Traverse the **branchMap**, **fnMap**, **statementMap** of the changed file's **coverageMap** to determine if they include the difference line numbers
3. **Covered** definition: The **branchMap**, **fnMap**, **statementMap** containing the difference line numbers are all covered

**Calculation Formula:**


```
Added (File) Line Coverage = Covered (File) Lines / Total Added (File) Lines
```

### **Added Branch Coverage**

**Calculation Logic:**
1. git diff between two commits to get the difference files => difference line numbers
2. Traverse the **branchMap** of the changed file's **coverageMap** to determine if it includes the difference line numbers
3. **Covered** definition: The **branchMap** containing the difference line numbers is covered

**Calculation Formula:**
```
Added Branch Coverage = Covered Branches / Total Added Branches
```

### **Added Function Coverage**

**Calculation Logic:**
1. git diff between two commits to get the difference files => difference line numbers
2. Traverse the **fnMap** of the changed file's **coverageMap** to determine if it includes the difference line numbers
3. **Covered** definition: The **fnMap** containing the difference line numbers is covered

**Calculation Formula:**
```
Added Function Coverage = Covered Functions / Total Added Functions
```

### **Added Statement Coverage**
**Calculation Logic:**
1. git diff between two commits to get the difference files => difference line numbers
2. Traverse the **statementMap** of the changed file's **coverageMap** to determine if it includes the difference line numbers
3. **Covered** definition: The **statementMap** containing the difference line numbers is covered

**Calculation Formula:**
```
Added Statement Coverage = Covered Statements / Total Added Statements
```
