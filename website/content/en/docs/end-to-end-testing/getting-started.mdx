# Getting Started

Unlike unit tests, end-to-end tests launch a browser, and our goal is to collect coverage data within the browser. So the complexity is relatively high. Here's the general process.

- Expose browser global variables and write coverage data to local storage at the right time
- After UI automation is completed, use [canyon-uploader](/docs/ecosystem/canyon-uploader) to read and aggregate coverage data from the local `.canyon_output` directory for reporting.
- Associate caseID with [Report ID](/docs/core-concepts/report-id) to ensure case traceability.
