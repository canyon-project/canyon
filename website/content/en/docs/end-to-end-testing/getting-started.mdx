# Getting Started

Unlike unit tests, end-to-end tests launch a browser, and our goal is to collect coverage data within the browser. Therefore, the complexity is relatively higher. Here is the general process.

- Expose the browser's global variables and write the coverage data to the local machine at the right time
- After UI automation is completed, use [canyon-uploader](/docs/ecosystem/canyon-uploader) to read and aggregate the coverage data from the local `.canyon_output` directory for reporting.
- Associate the caseID with the [Report ID](/docs/core-concepts/report-id) to ensure the case can be traced back.
