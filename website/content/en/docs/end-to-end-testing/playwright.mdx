# Playwright

In Playwright, get the context, write coverage data to local files during test execution, and finally use the canyon-uploader tool to aggregate and upload.

## Writing Coverage Data to Local Files

Here's a nodejs code example:

```ts copy
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';
import {test as baseTest} from '@playwright/test';

const canyonOutputDirPath = path.join(process.cwd(), '.canyon_output');

export const test = baseTest.extend({
  context: async ({context}, use) => {
    await context.addInitScript(() =>
      window.addEventListener('beforeunload', () =>
        (window as any).collectIstanbulCoverage((window as any).__coverage__)
      ),
    );
    await fs.promises.mkdir(canyonOutputDirPath, {recursive: true});
    await context.exposeFunction('collectIstanbulCoverage', (coverageJSON) => {
      console.log('Coverage collected',coverageJSON);
      if (coverageJSON) {
        fs.writeFileSync(path.join(canyonOutputDirPath, `coverage-final-${new Date().valueOf()}.json`), JSON.stringify(coverageJSON));
      }
    });
    await use(context);
    for (const page of context.pages()) {
      await page.evaluate(() => (window as any).collectIstanbulCoverage((window as any).__coverage__));
    }
  }
});

export const expect = test.expect;


```

## Aggregate Upload

Use the canyon-uploader tool to aggregate and upload. For specific usage, please see the [canyon-uploader](/docs/ecosystem/canyon-uploader) documentation.

```bash copy
./canyon-uploader map --dsn=https://canyonjs.org
```
