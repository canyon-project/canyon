# Changed Code Coverage

Changed code coverage allows you to focus on the test coverage of your code changes.

## Calculation Logic

1. Use git diff to get `added lines` and `deleted lines` for each file
2. Traverse through the file's coverage data, checking if `added lines` are covered in `all dimensions`
3. Calculate the changed code coverage for a single file. Formula: `(number of added lines - number of uncovered lines) / number of added lines`

> [!TIP]
>
> Many of the `added lines` do not belong to any of the `branches`, `functions`, or `statements` categories, but they are included in the calculation and are considered `covered` by default.
