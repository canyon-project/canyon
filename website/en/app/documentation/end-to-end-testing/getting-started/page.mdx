# Getting Started

Unlike unit tests, end-to-end testing launches a browser, and our goal is to collect coverage data within the browser. Therefore, the complexity is relatively higher. Here's the general process:

- Expose browser global variables and write coverage data to local storage at the appropriate time
- After UI automation is complete, use [canyon-uploader](/documentation/ecosystem/canyon-uploader) to read and aggregate coverage data from the local `.canyon_output` directory
- Associate the caseID with [Report ID](/documentation/core-concepts/report-id) to ensure case traceability
