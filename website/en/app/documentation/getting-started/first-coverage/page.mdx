# First Coverage Data

> [!NOTE]
>
> Canyon provides [installation guides for common frameworks](/documentation/installation/getting-started) to help you get started quickly.

Follow these steps to complete your first coverage data report:

## Start as a New Project

<Steps>
  ### Installation

In frontend engineering and modular development, Babel is indispensable. For Babel projects, you only need to install two Babel plugins to get started quickly.

```sh npm2yarn
npm install babel-plugin-istanbul babel-plugin-canyon -D
```

Add the [`istanbul`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-istanbul) and [`canyon`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-canyon) plugins to your [Babel configuration file](https://babeljs.io/docs/config-files#configuration-file-types):

  ```js filename="babel.config.js" {3,4} copy
  module.exports = {
    plugins: [
      'istanbul',
      'canyon'
      // Note the plugin order, canyon plugin should be after istanbul plugin
      ],
  };
  ```

### Verification

After configuration, start your project and print **window.\_\_coverage\_\_** in the console. If the output matches the image below, it indicates successful code instrumentation.

### Configure CI Environment Variables

In the CI environment, we need to configure some environment variables for reporting coverage data.

> [!TIP]
>
> Canyon detects pipeline variables during compilation. We support multiple [pipeline providers](/documentation/reference/provider).<br/>
> Don't see your pipeline provider? Try [explicit configuration](/documentation/ecosystem/babel-plugin-canyon#配置).


1. `DSN` and `REPORTER`

- **DSN**: Coverage data reporting service address, url/coverage/client, where url is the Canyon service address.
- **REPORTER**: User token, which can be viewed in the Canyon user settings page.

2. Configure CI Platform Variables

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Note that project ID, branch, and SHA don't need manual configuration - the Canyon plugin automatically detects pipeline environment variables.
</Callout>

  ### Update Babel Plugin Activation Conditions

  __In the CI phase, we need to control when plugins are active to prevent instrumentation on production branches.__

  ```js {2,3} copy
  module.exports = {
    plugins: (process.env.CI &&
              process.env.CI_COMMIT_REF_NAME !== 'release')
              ? [
                'canyon',
                'istanbul'
              ]:[],
  };
  ```

  ### Report Coverage Data

  After CI completes, the page is deployed to the test environment.

  At this point, coverage data is stored in the browser. As users operate or UI automation tests execute, the window.__coverage___ data continuously accumulates.

  By accurately reporting this data to the Canyon server, you can achieve real-time coverage data visualization.


  Here are several ways to report coverage data:
